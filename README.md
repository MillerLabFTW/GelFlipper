This repo provides fabrication files, Arduino code, and circuit schematics for our open-source gel flipping system for seeding endothelial cells into patterned vascular networks. See our [Nature Protocols paper](https://rdcu.be/clcY7) (specifically Box 1) for more info.

**Coming soon:** We have a second generation gel flipper design ready to launch. Fabrication files and assembly instructions will be posted shortly.
